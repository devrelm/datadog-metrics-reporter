# Datadog Metrics Reporter Action

[![CI](https://github.com/drewwyatt/datadog-metrics-reporter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drewwyatt/datadog-metrics-reporter/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/drewwyatt/datadog-metrics-reporter)

Report CI Metrics to Datadog.

This action captures conclusions and durations for jobs and steps from [context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-context) and the actions toolkit ([@actions/github](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/github)) and reports them to Datadog using autogenerated metrics keys.

## Usage

For this action to report accurate metrics, you need to (at least) ensure two things:

1. `datadog-metrics-reporter` is the last thing to run in your workflow (since it is only possible to report the status/duration of a job/step that has already completed).
2. `datadog-metrics-reporter` `always()` runs (so that failures are also reported).

You can achieve this by adding this to your workflow file as a separate job that [`needs`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds) every other job in the workflow _and_ set the [`if` conditional](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif) to `always()`.

e.g.

```yml
# ...

jobs:
  build:
    # ...
  test:
    # ...
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, test] # run these first
    if: always() # still run even if other jobs fail
    steps:
      - uses: drewwyatt/datadog-metrics-reporter@v0.5.0
        with:
          datadog-api-key: ${{secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY}}
          github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```
